## What You Should See

1. Click "Compare Keywords" toggle (top-right)
2. Select keywords from the left panel
3. You'll see **4 tabs**:
   - Performance Trends
   - Conversion Funnels
   - Market Share
   - **Change Analysis** ‚Üê NEW!
4. Click "Change Analysis" tab
5. Enable comparison dates (checkbox below date picker)
6. Waterfall chart appears showing keyword changes

### 3. Real Keywords in Selector
