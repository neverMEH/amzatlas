## Tasks

### 1. Implement Period Type Selector Component

Create the parent selection mechanism for period types (week, month, quarter, year).

#### Subtasks:
- [ ] Write unit tests for PeriodTypeSelector component with all four period types
- [ ] Create PeriodTypeSelector component with radio buttons/dropdown for period selection
- [ ] Implement state management for selected period type with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Add period type change handler that resets calendar state appropriately
- [ ] Integrate period type selector with existing DateRangePicker component
- [ ] Add visual styling consistent with current dashboard design
- [ ] Write integration tests for period type switching behavior
- [ ] Verify period type selector works correctly and updates dependent components

### 2. Update Calendar UI Based on Period Type

Modify the calendar display to show appropriate selection interfaces for each period type.

#### Subtasks:
- [ ] Write unit tests for calendar rendering logic for each period type
- [ ] Implement week selection view with colored date segments by week boundaries
- [ ] Create month selection view showing month/year picker interface
- [ ] Build quarter selection view with quarter and year selection
- [ ] Implement year selection view with year-only picker
- [ ] Add visual indicators for current selection in each calendar mode
- [ ] Handle edge cases for partial weeks at month boundaries
- [ ] Verify calendar UI updates correctly when period type changes

### 3. Implement Comparison Period Functionality

Add comparison period selection with default and custom options.

#### Subtasks:
- [ ] Write unit tests for comparison period calculation logic
- [ ] Implement automatic prior period calculation (same period, previous occurrence)
- [ ] Create comparison period toggle to enable/disable comparison
- [ ] Add custom comparison period selector for manual period selection
- [ ] Implement validation to prevent invalid comparison selections (future dates, overlapping periods)
- [ ] Add visual indicators showing both selected and comparison periods
- [ ] Handle comparison period updates when main period changes
- [ ] Verify comparison periods calculate correctly for all period types

### 4. Implement Custom Date Range Selection

Add functionality for custom date ranges using weekly intervals.

#### Subtasks:
- [ ] Write unit tests for custom range validation and calculation
- [ ] Create custom range input component (e.g., "Last 10 weeks")
- [ ] Implement week-based range calculation from current date backwards
- [ ] Add preset options for common ranges (4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, etc.)
- [ ] Validate custom range inputs (positive numbers, reasonable limits)
- [ ] Update calendar to highlight custom range selection
- [ ] Integrate custom ranges with comparison period logic
- [ ] Verify custom date ranges work correctly with data availability

### 5. Testing and Integration

Comprehensive testing and integration with existing dashboard components.

#### Subtasks:
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests covering all date selection scenarios
- [ ] Create integration tests for DateRangePicker with ASIN performance dashboard
- [ ] Test date selection with actual data queries to verify performance
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid date selections and edge cases
- [ ] Implement loading states during date range changes
- [ ] Test accessibility compliance for all new UI components
- [ ] Perform cross-browser testing for calendar components
- [ ] Verify complete date selection enhancement works end-to-end in production environment
