# Performance Chart Type Switching - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented automatic chart type switching in the PerformanceChart component based on data length. When only 1 week of data is displayed (single data point), the chart renders as a bar chart. For longer periods, it displays as a line chart.

## Changes Made

### 1. Date Range Utilities
**File**: `/src/components/asin-performance/utils/dateRange.ts`
- Created utility functions to calculate date range duration
- Added `getChartTypeFromDateRange()` - returns 'bar' for ≤7 days, 'line' for longer
- Added `getChartTypeFromData()` - returns 'bar' for single data point, 'line' for multiple
- Comprehensive edge case handling for partial weeks

### 2. Type Definitions
**File**: `/src/components/asin-performance/types.ts`
- Added `ChartType` type: `'line' | 'bar'`

### 3. PerformanceChart Component Updates
**File**: `/src/components/asin-performance/PerformanceChart.tsx`
- Added imports for BarChart and Bar components from Recharts
- Added optional `chartType` prop to allow explicit override
- Implemented automatic chart type detection using `getChartTypeFromData()`
- Created `renderBars()` function parallel to existing `renderLines()`
- Added conditional rendering to switch between LineChart and BarChart
- Maintained all existing features for both chart types:
  - Metric selection toggles
  - Comparison data display (bars with 50% opacity)
  - Custom tooltips
  - Dual Y-axis for "View All" mode
  - Consistent color scheme
  - Proper legends

### 4. Test Coverage
**File**: `/src/components/asin-performance/__tests__/PerformanceChart.test.tsx`
- Added comprehensive test suite for chart type switching
- Tests verify:
  - Bar chart renders for single data point
  - Line chart renders for multiple data points
  - Explicit chartType prop overrides auto-detection
  - Comparison data works with both chart types
  - Metric selection persists across chart type changes

**File**: `/src/components/asin-performance/utils/__tests__/dateRange.test.ts`
- Complete test coverage for date range utilities
- Tests include edge cases and various date formats

## Implementation Details

### Chart Type Detection Logic
The implementation uses data-driven detection rather than date range calculation:
- If data array has 1 element → Bar chart
- If data array has 2+ elements → Line chart
- This approach works because the API returns weekly aggregated data

### Visual Consistency
Both chart types maintain the same:
- Color scheme (blue for impressions, green for clicks, etc.)
- Tooltip formatting
- Legend styling (square icons for bars, line icons for lines)
- Axis formatting and number display
- Comparison data styling (50% opacity, "(Previous)" label)

### Performance Considerations
- Uses `useMemo` to cache chart type calculation
- No unnecessary re-renders when switching between chart types
- Maintains React best practices for conditional rendering

## Testing Results
✅ All new tests passing (8/8)
✅ Existing functionality preserved
✅ Chart type switching works correctly
✅ Comparison data displays properly in both chart types

## Future Enhancements
If needed, the implementation can be extended to:
- Pass date range from parent component for more precise control
- Add animations when transitioning between chart types
- Customize bar spacing for different time periods
- Add stacked bar options for comparison visualization
