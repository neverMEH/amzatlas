# Task 1: Brand Management System - Completion Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive brand management system that extracts brands from product titles and enables global brand-level filtering across all reports and dashboards.

## Completed Components

### 1. Database Schema (Migrations 018-023)
- **brands table**: Master table for all brands with normalization and hierarchy support
- **asin_brand_mapping table**: Maps ASINs to brands with confidence scores
- **product_type_mapping table**: Categorizes products by type
- **brand_performance_summary**: Materialized view for fast brand analytics
- **brand_hierarchy view**: Navigate brand parent-child relationships

### 2. Brand Extraction Functions
- `extract_brand_from_title()`: Uses regex patterns to extract brands from product titles
- `normalize_brand_name()`: Creates consistent brand names for matching
- `extract_product_type()`: Categorizes products into types (Audio, Computers, etc.)
- `get_or_create_brand()`: Safely creates brands avoiding duplicates
- `update_brand_mappings()`: Updates mappings after BigQuery sync

### 3. Weekly Update Process
- `weekly_data_update()`: Main orchestration function
- `validate_brand_mappings()`: Data quality checks
- `merge_brands()`: Handle duplicate brands
- `refresh_brand_statistics()`: Update brand performance metrics

### 4. Query Optimization
- Created 15+ indexes for efficient brand filtering
- Composite indexes for brand + date range queries
- Full-text search indexes for brand names
- Materialized view for pre-aggregated brand metrics

### 5. Helper Functions
- `get_brand_asins()`: Get all ASINs for a brand (with sub-brand support)
- `search_brands()`: Full-text search for brand discovery
- `track_brand_query()`: Usage tracking for optimization

## Key Features

### Brand Extraction Patterns
The system recognizes brands using multiple patterns:
- Direct brand names: "Apple iPhone 15"
- "by" pattern: "Echo Dot by Amazon"
- Trademark symbols: "Nike® Air Max"
- Separators: "JBL | Charge 5", "ASUS - ROG Laptop"
- Brackets: "[Amazon Basics] HDMI Cable"

### Confidence Scoring
- 0.75+ : High confidence automatic extraction
- 0.5-0.74 : Medium confidence, may need review
- <0.5 : Low confidence, needs manual verification
- 0.0 : Unknown brand

### Product Type Categories
- Audio (headphones, earbuds)
- Computers (laptops, desktops)
- Mobile Devices (phones)
- Tablets (iPad, Kindle)
- Cameras
- Speakers (smart speakers, soundbars)
- Wearables (smartwatches)
- Displays (TVs, monitors)
- Networking (routers, modems)
- Accessories (keyboards, mice)
- Power & Cables
- Cases & Protection
- Storage (SSDs, memory)
- Printers & Scanners
- Gaming
- Other

## Test Results

### Unit Tests
- 17/17 brand extraction tests passing
- Handles edge cases (empty strings, special characters)
- Accurate brand and product type identification

### Test Script
Created `test-brand-extraction.ts` that:
- Tests extraction accuracy with 20+ sample titles
- Validates against real ASIN data
- Reports brand mapping statistics
- Identifies low-confidence mappings for review

## Integration Points

### BigQuery Sync
- Automatically processes new ASINs after each sync
- Updates product titles if changed
- Creates new brands as discovered
- Maintains extraction audit trail

### API Integration
All dashboard APIs can now filter by:
- `brand_id`: Single brand filtering
- `include_sub_brands`: Include child brands
- Multiple brands via array parameter

### UI Components (Next Steps)
- Global brand selector in dashboard header
- Brand performance dashboard
- Brand comparison views
- Drill-down navigation (Brand → Product Type → ASIN)

## Migration Order
1. `018_create_brand_management_tables.sql`
2. `019_create_brand_extraction_functions.sql`
3. `020_add_product_title_column.sql`
4. `021_populate_initial_brands.sql`
5. `022_create_weekly_update_functions.sql`
6. `023_create_brand_optimization_indexes.sql`

## Usage Examples

### Get all ASINs for a brand
```sql
SELECT * FROM sqp.get_brand_asins(
  'brand-uuid-here',
  true -- include sub-brands
);
```

### Search for brands
```sql
SELECT * FROM sqp.search_brands('apple', 10);
```

### Run weekly update
```sql
SELECT sqp.weekly_data_update();
```

### Validate mappings
```sql
SELECT * FROM sqp.validate_brand_mappings();
```

## Next Steps
With Task 1 complete, the brand management infrastructure is ready. Task 2 will build the period-over-period reporting engine that leverages this brand filtering capability.
