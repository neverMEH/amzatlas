## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Component Architecture
**Decision**: Modular component design with separation of concerns  
**Rationale**: 
- Each period type has its own dedicated calendar component
- Comparison logic is isolated in utility functions
- Main DateRangePickerV2 acts as a coordinator component
- Enables independent testing and maintenance of each component

### 2. Date Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Use date-fns library for all date operations  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent date formatting across components
- Reliable timezone handling
- Rich set of utilities for date calculations
- Immutable date operations prevent bugs

### 3. State Management Approach
**Decision**: Local component state with callback props  
**Rationale**:
- Keeps components lightweight and reusable
- Parent component controls overall state
- Easy integration with existing dashboard state management
- Supports both controlled and uncontrolled usage patterns

### 4. Validation Strategy
**Decision**: Real-time validation with user feedback  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents invalid date selections before submission
- Provides immediate feedback for better UX
- Validates both main and comparison period selections
- Handles edge cases like overlapping periods and future dates

### 5. Calendar UI Design
**Decision**: Period-specific calendar interfaces  
**Rationale**:
- Week view shows week boundaries and numbers for precision
- Month view provides traditional calendar navigation
- Quarter view offers intuitive Q1-Q4 selection with date previews
- Year view enables quick year selection with decade navigation
- Custom view provides week-based range selection with presets

## Notable Bug Fixes and Issues Resolved

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Error
**Issue**: Missing return statements for 'custom' case in comparison period utility functions  
**Files Affected**: `/src/components/asin-performance/utils/comparisonPeriod.ts`  
**Fix**: Added proper handling for 'custom' PeriodType in all comparison calculation functions  
**Commit**: `878f8c0 - fix: Add missing return statements for 'custom' case in comparison period functions`

### 2. Calendar Integration
**Issue**: DateRangePickerV2 needed to properly coordinate between period type selection and calendar rendering  
**Solution**: Implemented dynamic calendar component rendering based on selected period type  
**Impact**: Seamless switching between different calendar views

### 3. Comparison Period Validation
**Issue**: Need to prevent invalid comparison period selections  
**Solution**: Comprehensive validation system that checks for:
- Overlapping periods
- Future dates
- Invalid date ranges
- Period consistency

## Technical Implementation Details

### TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
export type PeriodType = 'week' | 'month' | 'quarter' | 'year' | 'custom'

export interface DateRange {
  startDate: string
  endDate: string
}

export interface ComparisonRange extends DateRange {
  enabled: boolean
}

export interface PeriodSelection {
  type: PeriodType
  range: DateRange
  comparison?: ComparisonRange
}
```

### Key Algorithms

#### 1. Period Calculation
- **Week**: Uses `startOfWeek`/`endOfWeek` with Sunday as week start
- **Month**: Uses `startOfMonth`/`endOfMonth` for full month ranges
- **Quarter**: Uses `startOfQuarter`/`endOfQuarter` for Q1-Q4 ranges
- **Year**: Uses `startOfYear`/`endOfYear` for full year ranges
- **Custom**: Uses week-based calculations from current date backwards

#### 2. Comparison Period Logic
- **Previous Period**: Calculates same duration immediately before selected period
- **Year-over-Year**: Finds same period (week/month/quarter) in previous year
- **Custom Offset**: Allows manual specification of period offset (1-52 units)
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation to prevent invalid comparisons

#### 3. Calendar Rendering
- **Week View**: Shows month calendar with week boundaries highlighted
- **Month View**: Traditional month calendar with navigation
- **Quarter View**: Grid layout showing all four quarters with date ranges
- **Year View**: Decade view with year selection and navigation
- **Custom View**: Modal with preset options and custom week input

## User Experience Enhancements

### 1. Intuitive Navigation
- Period type selector with clear icons and labels
- Smooth transitions between different calendar views
- Consistent interaction patterns across all period types

### 2. Visual Feedback
- Selected periods highlighted in blue
- Comparison periods highlighted in purple
- Data availability indicators (green dots)
- Current date indicators
- Hover states for better interaction feedback

### 3. Smart Defaults
- Automatically selects current period when switching types
- Intelligently calculates default comparison periods
- Preserves user selections when possible during period type changes

### 4. Error Prevention
- Real-time validation prevents invalid selections
- Clear error messages guide users to valid selections
- Disabled states for unavailable options
- Maximum date restrictions to prevent future selections

## Integration with Existing Dashboard

### Dashboard Integration
- **Main Page**: `/src/app/page.tsx` updated to use DateRangePickerV2
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains same prop interface as original DateRangePicker
- **State Management**: Integrates seamlessly with existing dashboard state
- **API Compatibility**: Works with existing API endpoints without changes

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Calendar components only render when selected
- **Memoization**: Expensive date calculations are optimized
- **Event Handling**: Efficient event delegation and state updates
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and references

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Data Availability Integration**: Connect with actual data availability from Supabase
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Enhanced keyboard support for power users
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Adapt calendar views for mobile devices
