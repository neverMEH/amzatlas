## Environment Variables

No new environment variables required. The feature uses existing configuration.

## Database Changes

No database schema changes required. The feature works with existing data structure.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Verification
```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf .next
npm run build

# Verify no build errors
# Check bundle size hasn't increased significantly
```

### 2. Staging Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging via Railway
railway up -e staging

# Run smoke tests on staging
npm run test:e2e -- --env=staging
```

### 3. Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production via Railway
railway up -e production

# Monitor deployment
railway logs -e production
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Functionality Checks
- [ ] Smart suggestions appear when comparison is enabled
- [ ] All suggestion types working (Previous Week, Last Month, etc.)
- [ ] Manual selection still functional
- [ ] Tooltips displaying correctly

### 2. Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Check performance metrics in browser console
localStorage.setItem('DEBUG_SMART_COMPARISON', 'true')
// Navigate to dashboard and use the feature
// Check console for performance logs
```

### 3. Error Monitoring
- Monitor error tracking service for new errors
- Check browser console for client-side errors
- Review server logs for API errors

### 4. Analytics Verification
Track the following metrics:
- Smart suggestions usage rate
- Most selected comparison types
- Manual vs smart selection ratio
- Feature adoption rate

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected:

### 1. Quick Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to previous deployment
railway rollback -e production

# Verify rollback successful
railway status -e production
```

### 2. Feature Flag Disable (if implemented)
```javascript
// Disable feature via environment variable
ENABLE_SMART_COMPARISON=false
```

### 3. Manual Revert
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Deploy reverted code
railway up -e production
```

## Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **API Performance**
   - `/api/dashboard/v2/suggestion-metadata` response time
   - Cache hit rate
   - Error rate

2. **User Engagement**
   - Feature usage percentage
   - Average time to select comparison
   - Bounce rate on comparison selection

3. **System Health**
   - Memory usage
   - CPU utilization
   - Database query performance

## Support Documentation

### User FAQ
1. **Q: Why don't I see smart suggestions?**
   A: Ensure you have selected a date range and enabled comparison mode.

2. **Q: What do the confidence dots mean?**
   A: More dots indicate higher confidence based on data availability and recency.

3. **Q: Can I still manually select dates?**
   A: Yes, click "Use manual selection" to switch modes.

### Developer Notes
1. Cache is cleared on deployment - initial requests may be slower
2. Performance tracking is enabled in development and test environments
3. Debug mode can be enabled via localStorage

## Success Criteria

The deployment is considered successful when:
- [ ] All functionality tests pass in production
- [ ] No increase in error rate after 24 hours
- [ ] Performance metrics meet targets (<1ms avg response)
- [ ] User adoption rate >30% within first week
- [ ] No critical bugs reported
