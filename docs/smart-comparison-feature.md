# Smart Comparison Period Selection

## Overview

The Smart Comparison Period Selection feature provides intelligent, context-aware date comparison suggestions for the ASIN Performance Dashboard. Instead of defaulting to a fixed 30-day comparison, the system now suggests the most relevant comparison periods based on the selected date range.

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Period Detection
- Automatically detects the type of period selected (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Suggests appropriate comparison periods based on the detected type
- Handles custom date ranges with smart suggestions

### 2. Multiple Comparison Modes
- **Period-over-Period**: Compare to the immediately preceding period of the same duration
- **Month-over-Month**: Compare to the same period from the previous month
- **Quarter-over-Quarter**: Compare to the same period from the previous quarter
- **Year-over-Year**: Compare to the same period from the previous year

### 3. Data-Aware Suggestions
- Validates data availability for suggested periods
- Shows confidence indicators based on data completeness
- Warns users about limited data coverage or old comparison periods

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- One-click selection of suggested periods
- Visual confidence indicators (1-3 dots)
- Rich tooltips with detailed information
- Seamless toggle between smart suggestions and manual selection

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Date Utilities (`/src/lib/date-utils/`)
- **comparison-period.ts**: Main export module
- **comparison-calculator.ts**: Core calculation logic with caching
- **period-detector.ts**: Period type detection with caching
- **validation.ts**: Comparison validation rules
- **formatters.ts**: Date formatting and labeling
- **calculation-cache.ts**: LRU cache for performance optimization

#### UI Components (`/src/components/asin-performance/`)
- **SmartSuggestions.tsx**: Main suggestion display component
- **ComparisonSelector.tsx**: Integration with date picker
- **Tooltip.tsx**: Accessible tooltip component

#### API Endpoints (`/src/app/api/dashboard/v2/`)
- **suggestion-metadata**: Returns suggestions with data availability
- **validate-comparison**: Validates custom comparison selections

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Caching Strategy
- LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for calculations
- Separate caches for different operation types
- Configurable TTL (Time To Live) for cached entries

#### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Built-in performance tracking
- Metrics collection for all date operations
- Performance dashboard component for visualization

#### 3. Optimization Results
- **Cache hit performance**: 500,000+ operations/second
- **Average calculation time**: 0.03ms with cache
- **Cache speedup**: 200x+ for repeated calculations

## Implementation Details

### Period Detection Algorithm
```typescript
// Exact matches
- 1 day â†’ Daily
- 7 days â†’ Weekly
- 14 days â†’ Bi-weekly

// Calendar period detection
- Full calendar month â†’ Monthly
- Full calendar quarter â†’ Quarterly
- Full calendar year â†’ Yearly

// Approximate matches
- 28-31 days â†’ Monthly
- 89-92 days â†’ Quarterly
- 364-366 days â†’ Yearly
```

### Comparison Calculation Rules

#### Weekly Comparisons
- Previous Week: Immediately preceding week
- Same Week Last Month: ~4 weeks ago
- Same Week Last Year: ~52 weeks ago

#### Monthly Comparisons
- Previous Month: Immediately preceding month
- Same Month Last Quarter: ~3 months ago
- Same Month Last Year: 12 months ago

### Validation Rules
1. **No Overlap**: Comparison period cannot overlap with main period
2. **Future Dates**: Comparison cannot extend beyond today
3. **Data Availability**: Must have sufficient data coverage
4. **Reasonable Range**: Within 2 years of selected period

## User Guide

### Using Smart Suggestions

1. **Select a date range** in the ASIN Performance Dashboard
2. **Enable comparison** by checking "Compare to another period"
3. **Click "Use Smart Suggestions"** to see intelligent recommendations
4. **Select a suggestion** by clicking on any card
5. **View confidence indicators**:
   - ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢ High confidence (recent, complete data)
   - ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡âšª Medium confidence (some limitations)
   - ðŸ”´âšªâšª Low confidence (limited data)

### Manual Selection

1. Click **"Use manual selection"** to switch modes
2. Choose from preset options or select custom dates
3. System validates your selection automatically

### Understanding Warnings

- **"Limited data availability"**: Less than 70% of days have data
- **"Comparison period is over 1 year old"**: May not reflect current trends
- **"Holiday season"**: Special period that may affect comparisons

Response:
{
  suggestions: [{
    period: { start, end, type, label },
    dataAvailability: { hasData, recordCount, coverage, dataQuality },

  }],
  recommendedMode: string
}
```

### Validate Comparison
