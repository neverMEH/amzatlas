# BigQuery ASIN Analysis Results

## Summary
- **Total unique ASINs**: 85
- **Total records**: 210,648
- **ASINs longer than 10 characters**: 0
- **All ASINs are exactly 10 characters long**

## Key Finding
Contrary to the initial assumption, there are currently NO ASINs longer than 10 characters in the BigQuery data. All 85 unique ASINs are exactly 10 characters in length.

## Implications
1. The ASIN column length issue may be based on anticipated future data rather than current data
2. The migration to VARCHAR(20) is still beneficial as a preventative measure
3. The sync failures mentioned (4,622 records) might be from a different issue or future data

## Next Steps
- Verify if there's a different data source or time period that contains 11-character ASINs
- Check if the sync failures are due to other constraints (not ASIN length)
- Consider proceeding with the migration as a preventative measure for future data
