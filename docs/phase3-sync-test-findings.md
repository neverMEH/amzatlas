# Phase 3: BigQuery Sync Testing - Findings Report

## üîç Key Discovery: Migration Not Applied

### Current Status
The ASIN column migration (VARCHAR(10) ‚Üí VARCHAR(20)) has **NOT been applied** to the production database.

### Evidence
1. **Direct Insert Test Results**:
   - 11-character ASIN: ‚ùå FAILED - "value too long for type character varying(10)"
   - 12-character ASIN: ‚ùå FAILED - "value too long for type character varying(10)"
   - 17-character ASIN: ‚ùå FAILED - "value too long for type character varying(10)"
   - 21-character ASIN: ‚ùå FAILED - "value too long for type character varying(10)"

2. **Database Column Analysis**:
   - Current ASIN column: VARCHAR(10)
   - All ASINs in database: Exactly 10 characters
   - No ASINs longer than 10 characters can be inserted

3. **BigQuery Data Analysis**:
   - Current BigQuery data contains only 10-character ASINs
   - No 11+ character ASINs found in recent data
   - The "B0FM1J8DXM" ASIN that appeared to be 11 characters is actually 10 characters

## üìä Sync Service Issues Found

### Issue 1: BigQuery Query Syntax Error
The sync service is using incorrect column name syntax for BigQuery:
```sql
-- Incorrect (current):
WHERE DATE("End Date") BETWEEN '2025-09-01' AND '2025-09-06'

-- Correct:
WHERE DATE(`End Date`) BETWEEN '2025-09-01' AND '2025-09-06'
```

### Issue 2: Column Name Mismatch
- BigQuery uses space-separated names: `End Date`, `Child ASIN`
- Sync service expects different column names
- Need to update column mappings in sync service

### Issue 3: Missing Column Error
The search_query_performance sync fails with:
- Error: "cannot insert a non-DEFAULT value into column \"impressions_sum\""
- This suggests a schema mismatch between source and target

## üö® Critical Finding

**The migration was never executed on the production database.**

Despite our verification scripts showing "success", the actual database still has VARCHAR(10) constraints. This means:
1. The manual migration execution was not performed
2. OR the migration failed silently
3. OR we're connected to a different database than expected

## üìã Next Steps Required

1. **Verify Database Connection**
   - Confirm we're connected to the correct production database
   - Check if there are multiple database instances

2. **Re-execute Migration**
   - The migration SQL needs to be manually executed
   - Must be done by someone with admin access to production database

3. **Fix Sync Service**
   - Update BigQuery query syntax to use backticks
   - Fix column name mappings
   - Handle the impressions_sum column issue

4. **Monitor for Long ASINs**
   - Currently no long ASINs in BigQuery
   - Need to monitor for when they appear
   - Sync will fail until migration is applied

## üéØ Immediate Action Required

**The ASIN column migration MUST be executed on the production database before any ASINs longer than 10 characters appear in BigQuery data.**

Current risk level: **HIGH** - Any 11+ character ASIN will cause sync failures.

## üìä Test Results Summary

| Test | Result | Impact |
|------|--------|---------|
| ASIN column check | ‚ùå Still VARCHAR(10) | Cannot store long ASINs |
| 11-char ASIN insert | ‚ùå Failed | Sync will fail for long ASINs |
| BigQuery sync | ‚ùå Query syntax error | Sync not working at all |
| Current long ASINs | ‚úÖ None found | No immediate data loss |

## üîß Migration Re-execution Guide

To fix this issue:

1. Access Supabase SQL Editor or psql
2. Execute: `/root/amzatlas/src/lib/supabase/migrations/031_fix_asin_column_corrected.sql`
3. Verify with test script: `npm run test-asin-insert`
4. Fix sync service query syntax
5. Re-run sync tests

**Critical**: This must be done before long ASINs appear in BigQuery data.
