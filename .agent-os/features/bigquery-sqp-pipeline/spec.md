# Feature Spec: BigQuery Data Pipeline for SQP Data Processing

## Overview

Build a data pipeline to query, process, and analyze Amazon Search Query Performance (SQP) data that already exists in BigQuery. This pipeline will handle data extraction from BigQuery, transformation, aggregation, and loading processed results back into optimized tables for the application.

## Technical Requirements

- Authenticate with BigQuery and manage service account credentials
- Schedule regular data processing jobs to transform raw SQP data
- Query existing SQP data tables and perform aggregations
- Create optimized materialized views and summary tables
- Handle incremental processing of new data
- Implement retry logic for failed queries
- Provide monitoring and alerting for pipeline health

## Data Schema

The pipeline will work with existing BigQuery tables and create:
- `sqp_daily_summary`: Daily aggregated metrics by ASIN and keyword
- `sqp_weekly_trends`: Week-over-week performance trends
- `sqp_keyword_performance`: Keyword-level metrics with purchase attribution
- `sqp_competitive_analysis`: Market share and competitive metrics
- `processing_logs`: Pipeline execution and performance tracking

## Implementation Stack

- Language: TypeScript/Node.js for consistency with Next.js app
- Scheduling: Railway cron jobs
- BigQuery: Node.js client library
- Data Processing: SQL queries and BigQuery scripting
- Monitoring: Railway metrics + custom logging
