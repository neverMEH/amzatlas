# Brand Selection Dropdown - Quick Summary

## Problem
Currently only have "Work Sharp" brand hardcoded, but need to support multiple brands that will be added to BigQuery. The system needs to automatically detect new brands, associate ASINs with them, and allow users to filter dashboard data by selected brand.

## Solution
Build a comprehensive brand management system that:
1. Automatically extracts brands from product titles during BigQuery sync
2. Provides a sophisticated brand selection dropdown with search, hierarchy, and counts
3. Filters all dashboard data based on selected brand
4. Supports future growth with 100+ brands

## Key Features
- **Automatic Brand Detection**: Extract brands from product titles using pattern matching
- **Dynamic Dropdown**: Searchable, hierarchical brand selector with logos and ASIN counts  
- **Global Filtering**: Selected brand filters all dashboard data automatically
- **Admin Interface**: Manage brands, extraction rules, and ASIN mappings
- **Performance Optimized**: Caching, indexes, and materialized views for scale

## Database Changes
1. Add `brand_hierarchy` table for parent/child relationships
2. Add `brand_extraction_rules` table for pattern matching
3. Enhance `brands` table with logo, color, metadata
4. Update `asin_brand_mapping` with extraction metadata
5. Create materialized views for performance

## API Changes
- Fix `/api/brands` response format to `{ data: [], total: n }`
- Add `/api/brands/sync` for bulk brand extraction
- Add query parameters for hierarchy, counts, inactive brands
- Implement caching for brand lists

## UI Changes
- Replace basic dropdown with advanced `BrandSelector` component
- Add search, icons, ASIN counts to dropdown
- Create `BrandContext` for global state management
- Build admin interface for brand management
