# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-31-dynamic-popup-keyword-window/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-31
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Conditional Rendering Logic**: Implement view mode detection in KeywordAnalysisModal to differentiate between popup and full-page contexts
- **Sparkline Components**: Create new lightweight chart components using existing Recharts library:
  - `SparklineChart.tsx` - Minimal line/bar chart with no axes, labels, or legends
  - `MetricSparkline.tsx` - Single metric trend visualization
- **Layout Optimization**: Modify modal content layout to accommodate sparkline view:
  - Single column layout for popup
  - Horizontal sparkline arrangement
  - Reduced padding and margins
- **Chart Data Processing**: Simplify data for sparkline view:
  - Aggregate to appropriate time intervals based on date range
  - Show only primary metric per chart
  - Remove comparison overlays in popup view
- **Visual Indicators**: Add UI elements to indicate preview nature:
  - "Quick View" label or badge
  - Subtle "See Full Analysis" prompt near expand button
  - Reduced opacity or simplified styling for preview mode
- **Performance Optimization**: 
  - Lazy load full chart components only when needed
  - Minimize re-renders during modal animations
  - Use React.memo for sparkline components

## Approach

- Detect modal vs full-page context using a prop or route detection
- Create a `useViewMode()` hook to manage rendering logic
- Extend existing chart components rather than replacing them
- Maintain all existing data flows and API calls
- Preserve accessibility features in both view modes

## External Dependencies

- Recharts library (already in use) for sparkline components
- React hooks for view mode detection
- Existing KeywordAnalysisModal component structure
