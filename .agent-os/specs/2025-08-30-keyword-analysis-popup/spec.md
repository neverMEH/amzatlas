# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Keyword Analysis Popup
> Created: 2025-08-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enable users to click on keywords in the search query table to open a detailed analysis popup showing performance metrics, trends, and comparative insights for that specific keyword-ASIN combination. The popup provides deep-dive analytics with the ability to compare multiple keywords and optionally expand to a new tab for extended analysis.

## User Stories

### Interactive Keyword Analysis

As a product analyst, I want to click on any keyword in the search query table, so that I can instantly view detailed performance metrics for that specific keyword.

When I click on a keyword, a popup window appears showing time series charts of key metrics (impressions, clicks, conversions, etc.) for the selected keyword over the current date range. The popup displays a conversion funnel specific to that keyword and shows market share analysis. I can see how this keyword performs compared to the overall ASIN performance without leaving the main dashboard context.

### Multi-Keyword Comparison

As a marketing strategist, I want to compare up to 10 keywords simultaneously, so that I can identify patterns and opportunities across multiple search terms.

After opening the keyword analysis popup, I can select additional keywords (up to 10 total) from a searchable dropdown or by clicking other keywords while holding a modifier key. The interface shows both combined metrics and individual keyword breakdowns, highlighting unique insights and correlations between the selected keywords. This helps me understand keyword clusters and optimize my advertising strategy.

### Extended Analysis Mode

As a data analyst, I want to expand the popup into a full browser tab with breadcrumb navigation, so that I can perform deeper analysis with more screen space while maintaining context.

When I click the expand button in the popup, it opens in a new browser tab with the full keyword analysis interface. The new tab includes breadcrumbs showing the navigation path (Dashboard > ASIN > Keyword Analysis) and retains all the analysis state. I can adjust date ranges independently from the main dashboard and bookmark specific keyword analysis views for future reference.

## Out of Scope
