> Spec: Keyword Comparison Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-04

## Overview

Enhance the keyword comparison functionality in SQP Intelligence with full-width layout, KPI-enriched selection, filterable bar charts, and improved waterfall visualizations. This feature will enable users to make data-driven keyword decisions by providing comprehensive performance metrics and intuitive comparison tools.

## User Stories

### Informed Keyword Selection

As a marketing analyst, I want to see key performance indicators (KPIs) when selecting keywords for comparison, so that I can make informed decisions based on actual performance data rather than just keyword names.

The workflow involves opening the keyword analysis page, viewing a comprehensive list of keywords with their performance metrics (impressions, clicks, purchases, CTR, CVR), applying filters to focus on high-performing keywords, sorting by various metrics, and selecting multiple keywords for detailed comparison. This solves the problem of blind keyword selection where users previously had to guess which keywords were worth comparing.

### Full-Width Data Visualization

As a data analyst, I want to use the full screen width for keyword comparisons, so that I can view more data simultaneously and identify trends across multiple keywords without scrolling.

The enhanced layout provides a full-width comparison view that displays up to 8 keyword funnels simultaneously, shows comprehensive waterfall charts without truncation, and presents market share data in an easily digestible format. This addresses the limitation of the previous 3-column grid layout that restricted data visibility.

### Flexible Market Share Analysis

As a product manager, I want to filter and sort market share data by different metrics, so that I can identify competitive opportunities and understand my product's position across various performance dimensions.

Users can switch between different metric views (impressions, clicks, purchases, CTR, CVR), sort data to identify top performers, and export filtered results for further analysis. This replaces the static funnel view with a dynamic, interactive bar chart that adapts to different analytical needs.

## Spec Scope

1. **Full-Width Layout Implementation** - Transform the keyword comparison view from a 3-column grid to a full-width layout that maximizes screen real estate
2. **KPI-Enhanced Keyword Selector** - Add comprehensive performance metrics to the keyword selection interface with sorting and filtering capabilities
3. **Filterable Bar Chart Component** - Replace static funnel charts with an interactive bar chart supporting multiple metrics and sorting
4. **Waterfall Chart Improvements** - Fix usability issues and enhance the waterfall visualization with better tooltips and interactions
5. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - Create unit, integration, and performance tests for all new components

## Out of Scope

- Mobile responsive design (desktop-only optimization)
- Real-time data updates (uses existing data refresh patterns)
- Keyword recommendation engine
- Export to external analytics platforms
- Multi-ASIN comparison (focuses on single ASIN keyword analysis)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Full-width keyword comparison interface accessible at `/keyword-analysis` with enhanced data visualization capabilities
2. Keyword selector showing real-time KPIs with functional sorting and filtering that updates comparison view
3. Interactive market share bar chart with metric switching and data export functionality
