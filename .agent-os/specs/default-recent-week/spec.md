> Spec: Default Date Range to Most Recent Week
> Created: 2025-09-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the user experience by automatically setting the date picker on both the ASIN performance dashboard and keyword analysis page to default to the most recent complete week based on the current date. This ensures users immediately see the most relevant and up-to-date performance data without manual date selection.

## User Stories

**As a data analyst**, I want the dashboard to automatically show the most recent week's data when I first load the page, so that I can quickly assess current performance without having to manually select dates.

**As a product manager**, I want the keyword analysis page to default to the latest available data period, so that I can immediately see recent trends and make informed decisions.

**As a business user**, I want consistent date defaulting across all dashboard pages, so that I have a predictable experience when analyzing performance data.

## Spec Scope

- Implement intelligent date defaulting logic that calculates the most recent complete week
- Apply consistent date defaulting to both ASIN performance dashboard (`/`) and keyword analysis page (`/keyword-analysis`)
- Ensure the comparison period is automatically set to the previous week for immediate trend analysis
- Handle edge cases such as partial weeks and data availability
- Maintain existing manual date selection functionality
- Ensure the default behavior respects data availability and doesn't default to periods without data

## Out of Scope

- Modifying date ranges for other dashboard components not specified
- Changing the fundamental date picker UI/UX beyond default value setting
- Implementing user preferences for default date ranges (future enhancement)
- Adding custom date range templates or presets
- Modifying the Smart Comparison Period Selection feature logic

## Expected Deliverable

A seamless user experience where:
1. Users loading the ASIN performance dashboard see the most recent complete week's data immediately
2. Users accessing keyword analysis see the latest available performance data by default
3. Comparison periods are intelligently set to provide immediate trend insights
4. The solution is robust and handles various edge cases gracefully
5. Existing functionality remains unchanged for users who prefer manual date selection
