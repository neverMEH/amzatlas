# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: BigQuery Supabase Data Testing
> Created: 2025-08-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This spec focuses on testing and validating data population from BigQuery to Supabase tables to understand ASIN distribution patterns and determine optimal data selection strategies for different summary tables.

## User Stories

**Story 1: Data Population Validation**
As a developer, I want to test data sync from BigQuery to Supabase tables so that I can validate the data structure and content integrity after synchronization.

**Story 2: ASIN Distribution Analysis**
As a data analyst, I want to understand how multiple ASINs are populated across different summary tables so that I can identify patterns and optimize data distribution strategies.

**Story 3: Data Selection Strategy Optimization**
As a system architect, I want to test different data selection approaches (all ASINs vs subset vs single ASIN per table) so that I can determine the most efficient strategy for each table type.

## Spec Scope

1. Test data population from BigQuery to Supabase across multiple summary tables
2. Analyze ASIN distribution patterns and density across different table types
3. Validate data structure consistency between source (BigQuery) and destination (Supabase)
4. Compare performance and accuracy of different data selection strategies
5. Generate testing reports with recommendations for optimal ASIN selection per table

## Out of Scope

- Production data migration or permanent schema changes
- Real-time sync implementation or scheduling
- User interface development for data management
- Performance optimization of existing BigQuery queries

## Expected Deliverable

- Browser-accessible dashboard showing data population test results across different Supabase tables
- Validation report comparing source BigQuery data with populated Supabase data for accuracy verification
- Strategy recommendation document with optimal ASIN selection approach for each summary table type
