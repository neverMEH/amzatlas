# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Daily BigQuery Data Refresh
> Created: 2025-09-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement an automated daily trigger mechanism to refresh data from BigQuery source, ensuring all Supabase tables stay synchronized with the latest Amazon Search Query Performance data. This feature will automatically handle new data by either updating existing records or adding new entries, while ensuring dashboard compatibility for continuous weekly data updates.

## User Stories

### Automated Daily Data Synchronization

As a data analyst, I want the system to automatically refresh data from BigQuery every day, so that I always have access to the latest Amazon Search Query Performance metrics without manual intervention.

The system will execute a scheduled job daily that checks BigQuery for new data, processes any updates or additions, and ensures all dependent views and materialized views are refreshed. This eliminates the need for manual sync operations and ensures data consistency across all dashboard views.

### Real-time Dashboard Updates

As a dashboard user, I want to see new weekly data automatically reflected in all visualizations, so that I can monitor performance trends without waiting for manual updates.

When new weekly data becomes available in BigQuery, the refresh system will automatically sync it to Supabase and update all related summary tables, ensuring that dashboards immediately display the most current metrics including new weeks as they become available.

### Table Refresh Audit Trail

As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health and success of daily refresh operations, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any synchronization issues.

The system will maintain comprehensive logs of all refresh operations, including success/failure status, row counts, performance metrics, and any errors encountered. This provides visibility into the refresh pipeline's health and helps diagnose issues quickly.

## Spec Scope

1. **Daily Trigger Mechanism** - Automated scheduling system to execute BigQuery data refresh operations every 24 hours
2. **Intelligent Data Processing** - Logic to identify new or modified data and apply appropriate upsert operations
3. **Table Refresh Registry** - Centralized configuration tracking all tables requiring daily refresh with their specific requirements
4. **Monitoring and Alerting** - Comprehensive audit system with error handling, notifications, and performance tracking
5. **Auto-configuration for New Tables** - Automated process to add refresh capability to newly created tables

## Out of Scope

- Real-time streaming data updates (remains batch-based)
- Manual override capabilities for refresh scheduling
- Data transformation logic changes (uses existing transformers)
- BigQuery schema modifications
- Historical data backfilling beyond normal sync window

## Expected Deliverable

1. Automated daily refresh executing successfully for all configured tables with zero manual intervention required
2. Dashboard displaying current week's data within 24 hours of availability in BigQuery source
3. Monitoring dashboard showing refresh history, success rates, and performance metrics for all sync operations
