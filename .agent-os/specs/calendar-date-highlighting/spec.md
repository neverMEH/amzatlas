> Spec: Calendar Date Highlighting
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the date picker component to visually highlight dates that have available data in the system, helping users understand which dates they can select to see meaningful performance metrics. This feature will prevent users from selecting empty date ranges and improve the overall user experience by providing visual feedback about data availability.

## User Stories

As a user analyzing ASIN performance data, I want to see which dates have available data in the calendar so that I can make informed selections and avoid empty results.

As a product manager, I want users to easily identify data-rich periods so they can focus their analysis on meaningful time ranges.

As a dashboard user, I want visual indicators on the calendar that show data density so I can quickly identify periods with comprehensive data coverage.

## Spec Scope

- Add visual highlighting to calendar dates in the DateRangePicker component
- Implement data availability checking for individual dates
- Create distinct visual states for dates with different data densities (no data, sparse data, rich data)
- Add hover tooltips showing data availability summary for specific dates
- Ensure highlighting works for both start and end date selection
- Optimize performance to avoid excessive API calls when calendar is displayed
- Support both single ASIN and multi-ASIN data availability checking

## Out of Scope

- Modifying the underlying date picker library (keep using existing calendar component)
- Adding data pre-loading or caching beyond what's needed for highlighting
- Creating new API endpoints specifically for calendar highlighting (use existing data)
- Implementing date range suggestions based on data availability
- Adding bulk date selection features

## Expected Deliverable

A fully functional calendar date highlighting system integrated into the existing DateRangePicker component that:

1. Shows visual indicators for data availability on calendar dates
2. Provides hover tooltips with data summary information
3. Maintains existing date picker functionality while adding visual enhancements
4. Performs efficiently without impacting page load times
5. Works seamlessly with the current ASIN selection and comparison period logic
