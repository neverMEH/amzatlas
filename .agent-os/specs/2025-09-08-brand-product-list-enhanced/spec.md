# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Brand Product List Enhanced
> Created: 2025-09-08
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the existing brand dashboard product list with advanced filtering, expandable date segments, improved comparison displays, and optimized navigation to provide comprehensive brand-level product performance analysis with granular time-based insights.

## User Stories

**Story 1: Brand Manager Analyzing Product Performance**
A brand manager needs to analyze all products within their brand portfolio. They select a brand from the dropdown, view the enhanced product table with share metrics and comparison values, then expand date segments to see weekly/monthly breakdowns for specific time periods to identify performance patterns and trends.

**Story 2: Product Analyst Deep-Diving into ASIN Performance**
A product analyst reviewing brand performance identifies an interesting ASIN in the enhanced product table. They click on the ASIN to navigate to the detailed performance view while maintaining their current date range and comparison settings to ensure consistent analysis context.

**Story 3: Executive Reviewing Time-Segmented Performance**
An executive reviews brand performance across different time segments. They use the expandable date views to drill down from monthly to weekly performance, comparing current period metrics with historical data through enhanced percentage calculations and share metrics to understand market position changes.

## Spec Scope

1. Advanced brand-filtered ASIN display with optimized column structure including share metrics and enhanced comparison value presentations
2. Expandable date segment views that allow users to drill down into weekly and monthly performance breakdowns within selected date ranges
3. Enhanced comparison value displays with accurate percentage calculations and visual indicators for performance changes
4. Clickable ASIN navigation that preserves date range and comparison settings when transitioning to detailed ASIN performance views
5. Optimized column structure with integrated share metrics that provide market position context alongside traditional performance indicators

## Out of Scope

- Creation of new brand management functionality (existing brand selection system remains unchanged)
- Modification of core date range picker components (existing DateRangePickerV2 functionality preserved)
- Addition of new comparison period selection logic (existing smart comparison system maintained)
- Implementation of new API endpoints for basic brand data (existing brand dashboard APIs leveraged)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced brand dashboard product table with expandable date segments, improved comparison displays, and optimized column structure that maintains existing navigation patterns while adding granular time-based analysis capabilities
2. Seamless ASIN navigation functionality that preserves user context (date ranges, comparison periods) when transitioning between brand overview and detailed ASIN performance views
3. Comprehensive share metrics integration within the product table that provides market position insights alongside traditional performance metrics without disrupting existing dashboard workflows
