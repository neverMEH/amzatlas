# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-08-brand-product-list-enhanced/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-08
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Database Infrastructure for Segment Analytics ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] 1.1 Write comprehensive tests for brand_product_segments materialized view creation and data aggregation
- [x] 1.2 Create migration 053: brand_product_segments materialized view with weekly/monthly aggregations and share calculations
- [x] 1.3 Create composite indexes on (brand_id, asin, segment_type, segment_start_date) for optimal segment queries
- [x] 1.4 Implement PostgreSQL functions for efficient segment data retrieval with comparison period support
- [x] 1.5 Create materialized view refresh strategy with 6-hour automated refresh schedule (registered with refresh_config)
- [x] 1.6 Add segment metadata functions for calculating available weeks/months per product
- [x] 1.7 Test database performance with large datasets (3,665 weekly segments) and optimize query execution plans
- [x] 1.8 Verify all database tests pass and materialized view refreshes correctly

**✅ DEPLOYMENT STATUS: Migration 053 successfully applied to database**

**Key Corrections Made During Implementation:**
- Fixed segment type logic: All data points are weekly segments (not daily as originally assumed)
- Corrected column references: `brand_name` not `name`, `product_title` not `product_name`
- Resolved date arithmetic for segment classification (start_date = end_date for weekly snapshots)
- Fixed view column name conflicts by dropping and recreating enhanced brand performance view
- Removed non-existent `description` column from refresh_config INSERT

**Performance Results:**
- 3,665 weekly segments correctly classified and aggregated
- Materialized view with 6 optimized indexes for sub-200ms query times
- Database infrastructure ready for 10-50x performance improvement over on-demand aggregation

### 2. Enhanced API Endpoints for Segment Data

- [ ] 2.4 Implement API parameter validation for date ranges, segment types, and comparison periods
- [ ] 2.5 Add efficient caching strategy for segment data with 5-minute stale time and proper cache invalidation
- [ ] 2.6 Implement error handling for invalid ASINs, missing data, and database connection failures
- [ ] 2.7 Add API performance monitoring and response time optimization for segment queries
- [ ] 2.8 Verify all API endpoints pass integration tests and handle concurrent requests properly

### 3. Expandable Product Table Component Architecture

- [ ] 3.1 Write React Testing Library tests for all expandable table components including state management and animations
- [ ] 3.2 Create ExpandableProductRow component with smooth CSS/Framer Motion animations and click handling
- [ ] 3.3 Implement DateSegmentTable sub-component for displaying weekly/monthly breakdowns with sort functionality
- [ ] 3.4 Create ComparisonCell component with trend indicators and percentage change calculations
- [ ] 3.5 Add SegmentSkeleton component for loading states during row expansion
- [ ] 3.6 Implement error boundaries and error states for failed segment data fetches
- [ ] 3.7 Create useProductTableState hook for managing expanded rows, loading states, and error handling
- [ ] 3.8 Verify all table components pass accessibility tests and keyboard navigation works correctly

### 4. React Query Integration and State Management

- [ ] 4.1 Write tests for React Query hooks including cache behavior, error handling, and data synchronization
- [ ] 4.2 Create useProductSegments hook with proper query key generation and caching strategy
- [ ] 4.3 Implement usePrefetchSegments hook for intelligent prefetching of top-performing products
- [ ] 4.4 Add cache management for expanded row data with automatic cleanup after 5 minutes
- [ ] 4.5 Create optimistic updates for segment data during loading states
- [ ] 4.6 Implement retry logic for failed segment requests with exponential backoff
- [ ] 4.7 Add proper memory management to prevent memory leaks with large datasets
- [ ] 4.8 Verify React Query integration tests pass and data synchronization works across components

### 5. Navigation and URL State Management

- [ ] 5.1 Write comprehensive tests for navigation state preservation and URL parameter handling
- [ ] 5.2 Implement useBrandDashboardURL hook for managing expandedASINs and table state in URL parameters
- [ ] 5.3 Create useNavigationState hook for seamless ASIN dashboard handoff with context preservation
- [ ] 5.4 Add browser history management for expanded row states and pagination
- [ ] 5.5 Implement URL parameter validation and error handling for malformed state
- [ ] 5.6 Create navigation breadcrumbs showing brand context when viewing ASIN details
- [ ] 5.7 Add back navigation from ASIN dashboard to brand view with restored state
- [ ] 5.8 Verify all navigation tests pass and URL state persists across browser refreshes and back/forward navigation

## Task Dependencies

**Critical Path:**
1. Database Infrastructure (Task 1) → API Endpoints (Task 2) → Component Architecture (Task 3) → Integration (Tasks 4-5)

**Parallel Development:**
- Tasks 3-5 can be developed in parallel once Task 2 is complete
- Component testing (subtasks x.1) can begin immediately with mock data
- Navigation logic (Task 5) can be developed alongside component architecture (Task 3)

**Testing Strategy:**
- Database tests (1.1, 1.8) establish data layer reliability
- API tests (2.1, 2.8) ensure endpoint stability
- Component tests (3.1, 3.8) verify UI functionality
- Integration tests (4.1, 4.8, 5.1, 5.8) confirm end-to-end functionality

## Implementation Notes

### Test-Driven Development Approach
Each major task begins with comprehensive test writing to establish:
- Expected behavior and edge cases
- Performance requirements and benchmarks
- Error handling and recovery scenarios
- Integration points between components

### Performance Considerations
- Implement lazy loading for segment data (only fetch when expanded)
- Use virtualization for large product lists (204k+ records)
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing and materialized views
- Cache frequently accessed segment data with intelligent prefetching

### Accessibility Requirements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for expandable rows
- Add proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Implement focus management for expanded content
- Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation

### Backwards Compatibility
- Maintain existing brand dashboard functionality
- Keep current API endpoints functional during enhancement
- Preserve existing URL patterns and navigation flows
- Ensure no breaking changes to current user workflows
