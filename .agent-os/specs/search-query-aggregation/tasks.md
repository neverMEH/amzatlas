# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/search-query-aggregation/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-30
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Test Setup and API Enhancement

#### Task 1.1: Create API Tests for Keyword Aggregation
- [ ] Create test file: `src/app/api/dashboard/v2/asin-overview/__tests__/keyword-aggregation.test.ts`
- [ ] Write test cases for multi-week date ranges (>7 days)
- [ ] Write test cases for single-week date ranges (≤7 days)
- [ ] Test volume metrics aggregation (sum): impressions, clicks, cart_adds, purchases
- [ ] Test rate metrics aggregation (average): ctr, cvr, cart_add_rate, market_share, impression_share, click_share
- [ ] Test comparison period aggregation with same logic
- [ ] Test edge cases: no data, single query, multiple queries
- [ ] Verify aggregated data maintains data integrity (CTR = clicks/impressions)

#### Task 1.2: Enhance API Route Logic
- [ ] Modify `src/app/api/dashboard/v2/asin-overview/route.ts`
- [ ] Add date range calculation logic to determine if aggregation is needed
- [ ] Implement keyword aggregation function for current period data
- [ ] Implement keyword aggregation function for comparison period data
- [ ] Add utility functions for:
  - [ ] Summing volume metrics across weeks
  - [ ] Averaging rate metrics across weeks (weighted by impressions)
  - [ ] Grouping search queries by keyword
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility for single-week queries
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging

#### Task 1.3: Database Query Optimization
- [ ] Review current query in asin-overview API
- [ ] Optimize query to fetch all weeks efficiently when aggregation is needed
- [ ] Consider adding database indexes if needed for performance
- [ ] Test query performance with large date ranges

### Phase 2: Component Updates and Testing

#### Task 2.1: Update SearchQueryTable Component Tests
- [ ] Modify existing tests in `src/components/asin-performance/__tests__/SearchQueryTable.test.tsx`
- [ ] Add tests for aggregated data display
- [ ] Test that aggregated rows show single entry per keyword
- [ ] Test that aggregated metrics are correctly calculated
- [ ] Test sorting functionality with aggregated data
- [ ] Test filtering functionality with aggregated data
- [ ] Test pagination with aggregated data

#### Task 2.2: Update SearchQueryTable Component
- [ ] Review `src/components/asin-performance/SearchQueryTable.tsx`
- [ ] Ensure component handles both aggregated and non-aggregated data
- [ ] Update any hardcoded assumptions about data structure
- [ ] Verify sorting works correctly with aggregated metrics
- [ ] Ensure comparison percentage calculations work with aggregated data
- [ ] Update any tooltip text or labels to reflect aggregation behavior

#### Task 2.3: Update Type Definitions
- [ ] Review TypeScript interfaces in `src/lib/api/asin-performance.ts`
- [ ] Add any necessary type updates for aggregated data
- [ ] Ensure type safety for both aggregated and non-aggregated responses
- [ ] Update API response types if needed

### Phase 3: Integration Testing and Performance

#### Task 3.1: End-to-End Integration Tests
- [ ] Create integration tests that span from API to component
- [ ] Test full user flow: select ASIN → select multi-week date range → verify aggregated table
- [ ] Test comparison with previous period aggregation
- [ ] Test switching between single-week and multi-week date ranges
- [ ] Verify all dashboard components work correctly with aggregated data

#### Task 3.2: Performance Testing
- [ ] Test API performance with large date ranges (3+ months)
- [ ] Test component rendering performance with aggregated data
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during aggregation operations
- [ ] Benchmark before/after aggregation implementation
- [ ] Optimize if performance issues are identified

#### Task 3.3: Data Validation Testing
- [ ] Create validation tests to ensure aggregated metrics are mathematically correct
- [ ] Test that sum(volume_metrics) = total across all weeks for each keyword
- [ ] Test that average(rate_metrics) = weighted average across weeks
- [ ] Verify CTR = total_clicks / total_impressions after aggregation
- [ ] Verify CVR = total_purchases / total_clicks after aggregation
- [ ] Test edge cases: keywords that appear in some weeks but not others

### Phase 4: User Experience and Documentation

#### Task 4.1: Add User Feedback for Aggregation
- [ ] Consider adding visual indicator when data is aggregated
- [ ] Add tooltip or help text explaining aggregation behavior
- [ ] Update any existing documentation or help text
- [ ] Ensure user understands when they're viewing aggregated vs weekly data

#### Task 4.2: Error Handling and Edge Cases
- [ ] Handle cases where aggregation might fail
- [ ] Add proper error messages for aggregation failures
- [ ] Handle empty datasets gracefully
- [ ] Test behavior when comparison period has different keyword sets

#### Task 4.3: Manual Testing and QA
- [ ] Test with real production data across various date ranges
- [ ] Verify aggregated data matches manual calculations
- [ ] Test with different ASINs to ensure consistent behavior
- [ ] Test boundary conditions (exactly 7 days, 8 days, etc.)
- [ ] Perform user acceptance testing with sample scenarios

### Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring

#### Task 5.1: Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Review code changes for performance impact
- [ ] Update any deployment scripts if needed
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan if issues arise

#### Task 5.2: Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor API response times for aggregated queries
- [ ] Monitor for any errors in aggregation logic
- [ ] Validate aggregated data accuracy in production
- [ ] Collect user feedback on aggregation behavior

## Implementation Notes

### Aggregation Logic Details
- **Volume Metrics (Sum)**: impressions, clicks, cart_adds, purchases
- **Rate Metrics (Weighted Average)**: ctr, cvr, cart_add_rate, market_share, impression_share, click_share
- **Weighted Average Formula**: `sum(metric * impressions) / sum(impressions)`
- **Aggregation Threshold**: Date range > 7 days triggers aggregation

### Technical Considerations
- Aggregation should happen at API level for performance
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing single-week behavior
- Ensure data integrity is maintained during aggregation
- Consider caching aggregated results for frequently requested date ranges

### Testing Strategy
- Follow TDD approach: write tests first, then implement functionality
- Focus on data accuracy and mathematical correctness
- Test both happy path and edge cases thoroughly
- Use real data patterns for integration testing
