> Spec: Keyword Analysis Full Screen Enhancements
> Created: 2025-09-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the Keyword Analysis Full Screen feature to fix date range selection issues, improve market share visualization with top converting ASINs, and add comprehensive keyword comparison capabilities with waterfall charts. This will improve user experience and provide deeper insights into keyword performance across competitors.

## User Stories

### Date Range Selection Fix

As an Amazon seller, I want the date range selector to work properly, so that I can analyze keyword performance for specific time periods.

The user navigates to the keyword analysis page and clicks the date range selector. They should be able to select different period types (week, month, quarter, year, custom) and see the data update accordingly. The calendar should remain open until a selection is made and properly close after selection.

### Market Share Insights

As an Amazon seller, I want to see the top 5 ASINs that convert the most for each keyword, so that I can understand my competitive position and identify successful competitors.

When viewing keyword market share, the user sees a sorted list of the top 5 converting ASINs with their product titles, brands, conversion rates, and other key metrics. Each ASIN should be clickable, opening the main dashboard in a new tab with that ASIN pre-selected for detailed analysis.

### Keyword Comparison Visualization

As an Amazon seller, I want to compare multiple keywords visually using waterfall charts, so that I can quickly identify which keywords improved or declined and by how much.

In comparison mode with a date range selected, users can select multiple keywords and view a waterfall chart showing the top 10 performers. They can toggle between metrics (impressions, clicks, cart adds, purchases) to see positive and negative changes visualized as ascending or descending bars, making it easy to spot trends and opportunities.

## Spec Scope

1. **Date Range Selection Fix** - Resolve the calendar closing issue and ensure proper date range updates
2. **Enhanced Market Share Module** - Display top 5 converting ASINs with clickable links and detailed metrics
3. **Waterfall Chart Component** - Create interactive waterfall visualization for keyword comparison
4. **Metric Toggle System** - Enable switching between different performance metrics in comparison view
5. **Cross-Tab Navigation** - Implement ASIN selection that opens dashboard in new tab with context

## Out of Scope

- Mobile responsiveness (desktop-only as per project standards)
- Keyword search or filtering functionality
- Export functionality for waterfall charts
- Real-time data updates
- Historical data beyond existing database limits

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working date range selector that properly updates data and maintains calendar state
2. Market share module showing top 5 converting ASINs with clickable navigation to dashboard
3. Interactive waterfall chart in comparison mode showing top 10 keywords with positive/negative variance visualization for selected metrics
