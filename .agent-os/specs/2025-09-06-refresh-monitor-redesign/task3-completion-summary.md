# Task 3: Enhanced API Endpoints - Completion Summary

## Overview
Task 3 focused on enhancing the refresh monitor API endpoints to provide accurate monitoring of the core data pipeline tables. This task was completed successfully on 2025-09-07.

## What Was Accomplished

### 3.1 Enhanced Tests for Refresh Status API ✅
- Added comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
- Tests for core table prioritization
- Tests for sync_log integration
- Tests for data freshness scoring
- Tests for critical table monitoring
- Tests for the new alerts system

### 3.2 Updated /api/refresh/status Endpoint ✅
- Added CORE_TABLES constant defining the 7 critical tables to monitor
- Implemented freshness score calculation (0-100 scale)
- Added is_core flag to identify priority tables
- Enhanced table status determination logic
- Integrated sync_log data for pipeline activity monitoring

### 3.3 Sync Log Integration ✅
- Added queries to fetch sync_log data alongside refresh_audit_log
- Created pipeline_activity section in response
- Unified activity tracking from both refresh and sync operations
- Provides comprehensive view of data pipeline health

### 3.4 New /api/refresh/health Endpoint ✅
- Created comprehensive health check system
- Database connectivity check
- Core tables configuration validation
- Sync activity monitoring
- Data freshness assessment
- Stale table detection
- Pipeline metrics integration
- Overall health score calculation (0-100)
- Actionable recommendations for issues

### 3.5 New /api/refresh/tables Endpoint ✅
- Table-specific metrics and trends
- Categorization by table type (Data Pipeline, Core Data, Brand Management, etc.)
- Health scores for individual tables
- Success rate calculations
- Average refresh duration tracking
- Row count monitoring
- Trend data for refresh times and success rates
- Support for filtering by category or specific table

### 3.6 Data Freshness Scoring ✅
- Implemented calculateFreshnessScore function
- Score based on time since last refresh vs expected frequency
- 100 = just refreshed, 0 = very stale
- Integrated into both /api/refresh/status and /api/refresh/tables

### 3.7 Alerts System ✅
- Comprehensive alert generation based on system state
- Three severity levels: critical, warning, info
- Alert types:
  - Core table failures (critical)
  - Pipeline monitoring failures (critical)
  - Data freshness critical issues
  - High failure rates (warning)
  - Multiple stale tables (warning)
  - No recent activity (info)
- Alert summary with counts by severity
- Automatic overall status adjustment based on alerts

## Key Improvements

1. **Focus on Core Tables**: The system now prioritizes monitoring of the 7 critical tables identified in migration 048, rather than trying to monitor obsolete tables.

2. **Real Pipeline Activity**: Integration with sync_log provides actual BigQuery sync activity data, not just refresh configurations.

3. **Actionable Intelligence**: The health endpoint provides specific recommendations for addressing issues, not just status reports.

4. **Comprehensive Metrics**: The tables endpoint provides detailed metrics and trends for performance analysis and troubleshooting.

5. **Proactive Alerting**: The alerts system identifies issues before they become critical, enabling preventive maintenance.

## API Endpoints Summary

### GET /api/refresh/status
Returns comprehensive system status with:
- Overall health status
- Statistics summary
- Table details with freshness scores
- Recent activity from refresh logs
- Pipeline activity from sync logs
- Critical tables needing attention
- Alerts with severity levels
- Core tables reference

### GET /api/refresh/health
Returns system health overview with:
- Overall health status and score
- Individual health checks
- Actionable recommendations
- Threshold configuration

### GET /api/refresh/tables
Returns detailed table metrics with:
- Individual table metrics and status
- Category grouping
- Trend data
- Support for filtering by category or table name

## Next Steps

With the API layer complete, the next phase (Task 4) will focus on updating the UI components to consume these enhanced endpoints and provide a better user experience for monitoring the data pipeline health.

## Technical Notes

- All endpoints include comprehensive error handling
- Tests are written using Vitest framework
- Supabase client is properly mocked in tests
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety
- Performance considerations included (e.g., limiting query results)
