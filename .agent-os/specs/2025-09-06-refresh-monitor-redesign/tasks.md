## Tasks

- [x] 1. Analysis and Infrastructure Audit
  - [x] 1.1 Write tests for current refresh infrastructure analysis
  - [x] 1.2 Audit current refresh_config table entries and identify stale data
  - [x] 1.3 Identify core tables that actually need monitoring (asin_performance_data, search_query_performance, sync_log, brands, etc.)
  - [x] 1.4 Analyze actual data flow and sync patterns vs configured tables
  - [x] 1.5 Document discrepancies between refresh_config and actual sync activity
  - [x] 1.6 Create migration plan to clean up stale refresh configurations
  - [x] 1.7 Verify all tests pass

- [x] 2. Database Schema and Configuration Cleanup
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for refresh configuration cleanup
  - [x] 2.2 Create migration to remove obsolete tables from refresh_config
  - [x] 2.3 Add proper refresh configurations for core sync tables (sync_log, data_quality_checks)
  - [x] 2.4 Update refresh configurations for brand management tables (brands, asin_brand_mapping, product_type_mapping)
  - [x] 2.5 Configure monitoring for report system tables (report_configurations, report_execution_history)
  - [x] 2.6 Set appropriate refresh frequencies and priorities for each table category
  - [x] 2.7 Apply database changes to development environment

  - [ ] 4.6 Implement data freshness indicators with visual health status
  - [ ] 4.7 Add filtering and categorization for different table types
  - [ ] 4.8 Remove or redesign webhook monitoring (if not actively used)
  - [ ] 4.9 Verify all tests pass

- [ ] 5. Enhanced Monitoring and Alerts
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for monitoring and alert system
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement data staleness detection based on table criticality

  - [ ] 5.4 Add sync performance metrics and trend analysis
  - [ ] 5.5 Implement automated health checks for data pipeline integrity
  - [ ] 5.6 Create alert thresholds based on table importance and sync frequency
  - [ ] 5.7 Add email/notification system for critical sync failures
  - [ ] 5.8 Verify all tests pass

- [ ] 6. Integration with Actual Sync Infrastructure  
  - [ ] 6.1 Write tests for sync infrastructure integration
  - [ ] 6.2 Connect monitoring to actual BigQuery sync operations
  - [ ] 6.3 Integrate with edge function refresh orchestrator
  - [ ] 6.4 Add monitoring for manual sync script executions
