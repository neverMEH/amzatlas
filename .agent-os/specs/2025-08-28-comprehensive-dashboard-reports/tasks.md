## Completed Implementation Details

### 1. Brand Management System
- Created comprehensive SQL migrations (018-023) for brand tables and functions
- Implemented brand extraction from product titles using PostgreSQL functions
- Built hierarchical brand structure with parent-child relationships
- Created automated brand mapping update functions
- Fixed all database migration errors and column dependencies

### 2. Period-over-Period Reporting
- Created materialized views for WoW, MoM, QoQ, and YoY comparisons
- Implemented 6-week rolling average calculations
- Built statistical anomaly detection with Z-score analysis
- Created keyword trend classification (emerging, declining, stable, volatile)
- Optimized queries with proper indexes and view refresh strategies

### 3. API Layer Development
- Built RESTful APIs for all dashboard features:
  - `/api/brands` - Brand management and hierarchy
  - `/api/period-comparison` - Period-over-period analysis
  - `/api/keyword-trends` - Trend analysis with rolling averages
  - `/api/anomalies` - Statistical anomaly detection
  - `/api/reports` - Report generation and configuration
- Implemented proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Added error handling and input validation

### 4. Dashboard UI Components
- Created React components with TypeScript:
  - `BrandSelector` - Hierarchical brand selection with search
  - `PeriodComparisonDashboard` - Interactive period comparisons
  - `KeywordTrendsVisualization` - Trend charts with anomaly highlighting
  - `AnomalyDetectionAlerts` - Real-time anomaly notifications
  - `ComprehensiveMetricsDashboard` - Integrated dashboard view
