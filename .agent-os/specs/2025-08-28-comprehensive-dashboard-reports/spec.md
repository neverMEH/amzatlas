# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Comprehensive Dashboard Reports
> Created: 2025-08-28

## Overview

Completely redesign the SQP Intelligence dashboard to provide comprehensive period-over-period reporting capabilities (WoW, MoM, QoQ, YoY) for Amazon Search Query Performance data. This will transform the platform from basic metrics visualization into a powerful analytical tool that tracks trends, identifies opportunities, and provides actionable insights through automated report generation.

## User Stories

### Executive Performance Monitoring

As an Amazon agency executive, I want to see period-over-period performance comparisons, so that I can quickly identify trends, spot issues early, and make data-driven strategic decisions.

The dashboard should present high-level KPIs with automatic period comparisons, highlighting significant changes in market share, conversion rates, and revenue metrics. I need to drill down from executive summary views into detailed query-level and ASIN-level analysis, with all data automatically comparing to previous periods to show growth or decline trends.

### Brand Manager

As a brand manager, I want to select my brand at the top level and have all dashboards and reports automatically filtered to show only my brand's performance, so that I can focus on relevant data without manual filtering.

The system should extract brand names from product titles, provide a persistent brand selector that maintains context across all views, and allow me to see brand-level summaries before drilling down to individual ASINs. I need to compare my brand's performance against the total market and track how different product lines within my brand are performing.

### Search Performance Analyst

As a search performance analyst, I want to track query volume trends with 6-week rolling averages and statistical anomaly detection within my selected brand context, so that I can identify emerging opportunities and declining keywords before they significantly impact performance.

The system should automatically calculate rolling averages, Z-scores for anomaly detection, and classify keywords as emerging, declining, stable, or volatile based on trend analysis. I need to see trend bands showing actual performance versus 6-week averages, heat maps of keyword deviations from baseline, and drill down from brand level to product type to individual ASIN performance. The analysis should distinguish between normal seasonal patterns and actual performance changes requiring action.

### Pricing Strategy Manager

As a pricing strategy manager, I want to analyze price-performance correlations across different time periods, so that I can optimize pricing for maximum conversion and profitability.

The dashboard must show median prices at each funnel stage (click, cart add, purchase) with period comparisons, identify price elasticity trends, and highlight how competitor pricing affects our market share. I need visualizations that clearly show the relationship between price changes and conversion rate impacts over time.

## Spec Scope

1. **Brand-Level Selection System** - Global brand selector that filters all reports and dashboards, with brand extraction from product titles and hierarchical brand → ASIN → query navigation
2. **Period-over-Period Reporting Engine** - Automated calculation and comparison of metrics across WoW, MoM, QoQ, and YoY timeframes with configurable date ranges and brand context
3. **Keyword Trend Analysis System** - Advanced keyword performance tracking with 6-week rolling averages, statistical anomaly detection (Z-scores), and multi-level aggregation (ASIN, Product Type, Brand levels)
4. **Enhanced Dashboard UI** - Complete redesign with brand-first navigation, drill-down capabilities, interactive charts, trend bands visualization, and customizable report views for different user roles
5. **Automated Report Generation** - Scheduled report creation with insights, anomaly detection, and actionable recommendations based on trend analysis at brand and ASIN levels
6. **Advanced Filtering System** - Multi-dimensional filtering by brand, ASIN, query, date range, funnel stage, and custom metric thresholds with persistent brand context
7. **Performance Optimization** - Materialized views and caching strategies to handle complex period comparisons and rolling calculations on 200k+ records efficiently with brand-level aggregations

## Out of Scope

- Real-time streaming data updates (keeping current batch processing)
- Predictive analytics or machine learning forecasting
- Integration with external advertising platforms
- Mobile native application development
- Custom report builder UI (using predefined report templates only)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully functional dashboard with global brand selector showing all four report types (WoW, MoM, QoQ, YoY) with interactive filtering and drill-down capabilities accessible at /dashboard, maintaining brand context across all views
2. Keyword trend analysis dashboard with 6-week rolling averages, statistical anomaly detection, and multi-level aggregation views (Brand → Product Type → ASIN), including visualizations with trend bands and heat maps
3. API endpoints returning brand-filtered period comparison data with sub-second response times for standard date ranges and ability to export brand-specific reports in JSON/CSV formats
4. Automated weekly email reports showing brand-level and ASIN-level performance changes, keyword trend alerts for significant deviations (>2 standard deviations), and trending insights with configurable alert thresholds
5. Brand extraction system that automatically identifies and groups ASINs by brand based on product titles, with ability to manually override brand assignments if needed
