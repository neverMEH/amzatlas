> Status: Planning

## Overview

Build a comprehensive dashboard to test and visualize SQP purchase reports, enabling product owners and data analysts to explore purchase performance data through interactive widgets and custom filtered views.

## User Stories

### As a product owner testing the SQP pipeline
- I want to view purchase performance reports with key metrics widgets
- So that I can validate the SQP pipeline functionality and monitor purchase data accuracy

### As a data analyst
- I want to explore custom views and filters on the purchase data
- So that I can create tailored analysis views and identify data patterns for strategic insights

## Spec Scope

- **Purchase Performance Dashboard** with key metrics widgets displaying essential SQP purchase KPIs
- **Report Viewer** for testing and displaying all 4 categories of reports:
  - Performance Reports
  - Growth Reports  
  - ROI Reports
  - Strategic Reports
- **Custom View Builder** for creating filtered data views with dynamic filtering capabilities
- **Daily data refresh system** to ensure dashboard displays current purchase information
- **Untitled UI component integration** for consistent design system implementation

## Out of Scope

- Multi-user authentication and user management
- Real-time streaming updates (daily refresh is sufficient for testing phase)
- Mobile-specific layouts and responsive design optimization
- Export functionality (CSV, PDF exports not included in initial version)

## Expected Deliverable

- Functional dashboard displaying SQP purchase metrics with interactive widgets
- Working report viewer capable of displaying all four report categories
- Custom view creation capability with filtering and data exploration tools
