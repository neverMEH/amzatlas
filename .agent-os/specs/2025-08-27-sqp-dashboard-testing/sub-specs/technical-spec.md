## Integration Requirements

### BigQuery Connection
- Secure connection using service account credentials
- Connection pooling for efficient resource utilization
- Query optimization for SQP data structures
- Parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks

### Supabase Integration
- Custom view storage and retrieval
- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time updates for collaborative features
- Row-level security for multi-tenant data isolation

### Redis Caching
- Report data caching with TTL expiration
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Distributed caching for horizontal scaling
- Cache warming for frequently accessed reports

## Performance Criteria

### Load Time Requirements
- **Initial dashboard load**: Under 3 seconds
- **Report switching**: Under 1 second
- **Widget interactions**: Under 500ms response time
- **Data refresh**: Background updates without blocking UI

### Dataset Support
- Support for datasets up to **100k keywords**
- Pagination for large result sets
- Virtual scrolling for table components
- Progressive data loading for better perceived performance

### Optimization Strategies
- Code splitting by route and component
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Bundle size monitoring and optimization
- Memory leak prevention and cleanup

## Approach

### Architecture Pattern
- Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Component-based design with reusable UI elements
- Service layer for data access and business logic
- Custom hooks for shared functionality

### Data Flow
1. Server-side data fetching from BigQuery
2. Data transformation and processing
3. Caching in Redis for subsequent requests
4. Client-side state management with React Query
5. Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

### Development Workflow
- Component-driven development with Storybook
- Test-driven development with Jest and React Testing Library
- Continuous integration with automated testing
- Performance monitoring and alerting

## External Dependencies

- Advanced caching and synchronization features
- DevTools integration for debugging

### Utilities
- **date-fns** for date manipulation and formatting
- Tree-shakable utility functions
- Consistent date handling across the application

### Layout and Interaction
- **react-grid-layout** for dashboard customization
- Touch and mouse interaction support
- Responsive breakpoint handling

### Development Tools
- TypeScript for type safety
