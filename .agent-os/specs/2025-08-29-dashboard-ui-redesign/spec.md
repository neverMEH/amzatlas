> Spec: SQP Intelligence Dashboard UI Redesign
> Created: 2025-08-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

The SQP Intelligence Dashboard requires a comprehensive UI redesign to modernize the interface and optimize space utilization through the implementation of Untitled UI React components and a sidebar navigation structure. The current dashboard uses a top navigation approach that limits vertical screen real estate and employs inconsistent UI components that don't align with modern design standards.

This redesign will restructure the navigation from a horizontal header-based layout to a collapsible sidebar navigation system, replace existing UI components with Untitled UI's professional React component library, and optimize the overall layout to maximize data visualization space while maintaining excellent user experience and accessibility standards.

The project will maintain all existing functionality while significantly improving the visual design, user interface consistency, and space efficiency of the dashboard. This includes preserving the current data fetching patterns, API integrations, and core business logic while modernizing the presentation layer.

## User Stories

### As a business analyst using the SQP Intelligence Dashboard, I want:
- A collapsible sidebar navigation so I can maximize screen space for data visualization when analyzing large datasets
- Consistent, professional UI components throughout the dashboard so the interface feels cohesive and modern
- Better visual hierarchy and spacing so I can quickly scan and interpret performance metrics
- Responsive design that works well on different screen sizes so I can access insights from various devices

### As a marketing manager reviewing Amazon search performance, I want:
- Quick navigation between different dashboard sections through an intuitive sidebar so I can efficiently move between market share, conversion, and ROI analysis
- Clean, uncluttered charts and metrics displays so I can focus on the data insights without visual distractions
- Professional appearance that matches enterprise software standards so I can confidently present findings to stakeholders

### As a product owner overseeing the dashboard development, I want:
- A modern component library that provides consistent design patterns so future feature development is faster and more consistent
- Improved accessibility compliance so the dashboard meets enterprise accessibility standards
- Maintainable code structure that separates layout concerns from business logic so the team can iterate more efficiently

## Spec Scope

### Navigation Restructure
- Convert existing top navigation to a collapsible sidebar navigation system
- Implement proper navigation state management with active states and route highlighting
- Add navigation icons and labels for improved usability
- Ensure mobile responsiveness with appropriate sidebar behavior on smaller screens

### Component Library Migration
- Replace all existing UI components with Untitled UI React components including:
  - Buttons, form inputs, and interactive elements
  - Cards, panels, and container components  
  - Tables, data display, and list components
  - Charts integration with Untitled UI styling
  - Loading states, tooltips, and feedback components
- Establish consistent spacing, typography, and color system based on Untitled UI design tokens
- Implement proper component composition patterns for scalability

### Layout Optimization
- Redesign main dashboard layout to maximize vertical space utilization
- Optimize chart and metrics display areas for better data visualization
- Improve responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Maintain existing data fetching patterns and API integration points

### Design System Implementation  
- Apply Untitled UI's design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows
- Implement consistent interaction patterns and micro-animations
- Ensure accessibility compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Create reusable layout components for future development

## Out of Scope

### Backend and Data Layer
- No changes to existing API endpoints or data structures
- No modifications to BigQuery integration or data sync processes
- No alterations to Supabase database schema or queries

### Business Logic Changes
- No modifications to existing dashboard metrics calculations
- No changes to data processing or transformation logic  
- No alterations to existing feature functionality or user workflows

### Advanced Features
- No implementation of new dashboard features or analytics capabilities
- No addition of new data visualizations or chart types beyond styling updates
- No user management or authentication system changes
- No performance optimization beyond what's achieved through component updates

### Third-party Integrations
- No changes to existing Recharts integration beyond styling coordination
- No modifications to existing monitoring or analytics tracking
- No updates to deployment or infrastructure configurations

## Expected Deliverable

### Updated Dashboard Application
A fully redesigned SQP Intelligence Dashboard with:
- Modern sidebar navigation replacing the current header navigation
- Complete integration of Untitled UI React components throughout the interface
- Optimized layouts that maximize data visualization space
- Consistent design system implementation with proper spacing, typography, and colors
- Maintained functionality with all existing features working as expected

### Technical Implementation
- Updated React components following Untitled UI patterns and best practices
- Proper component composition and reusability for future development
- Responsive design implementation that works across desktop and mobile devices
- Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Clean separation between layout/presentation logic and existing business logic

### Documentation and Handoff
- Component usage guidelines for the implemented Untitled UI components
- Design system documentation covering colors, spacing, and typography standards
- Updated development guidelines for maintaining consistency in future updates
