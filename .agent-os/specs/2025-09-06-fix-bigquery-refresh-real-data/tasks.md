# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-06-fix-bigquery-refresh-real-data/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-06
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Validation ✅
- [x] **Verify current ASIN column constraints**: Check existing ASIN column lengths across all tables in Supabase
- [x] **Identify affected tables**: Document all tables that need ASIN column updates (asin_performance_data, search_query_performance, etc.)
- [x] **Count records with long ASINs in BigQuery**: Query BigQuery to identify how many ASINs are 11+ characters
- [x] **Backup current database state**: Create backup or snapshot of current Supabase database before migration
- [x] **Test migration script syntax**: Validate the migration SQL syntax without executing against production

### Phase 2: Migration Execution ✅
- [x] **Execute ASIN column migration**: Run `031_fix_asin_column_corrected.sql` against real Supabase database
- [x] **Monitor migration progress**: Track migration execution time and resource usage
- [x] **Verify migration completion**: Confirm all ASIN columns are updated to VARCHAR(20)
- [x] **Check for migration errors**: Review logs for any constraint violations or data issues
- [x] **Validate data integrity**: Ensure no data loss occurred during column modification

### Phase 3: BigQuery Sync Testing
- [ ] **Execute full BigQuery sync**: Run `npm run sync:nested-bigquery` with real data
- [ ] **Monitor sync for ASIN length issues**: Watch for any remaining length constraint errors
- [ ] **Verify 11-character ASINs sync**: Confirm long ASINs now appear in Supabase tables
- [ ] **Check sync completion**: Ensure sync processes all expected records without failures
- [ ] **Validate sync performance**: Monitor sync time and resource usage compared to previous runs

### Phase 4: Dashboard Data Validation
- [ ] **Test ASIN selector**: Verify all ASINs (including 11-character ones) appear in dropdown
- [ ] **Check data completeness**: Confirm performance data displays for all ASINs
- [ ] **Validate metrics accuracy**: Ensure metrics calculations work correctly with all ASINs
- [ ] **Test keyword analysis**: Verify keyword data displays properly for all ASIN lengths
- [ ] **Check date range functionality**: Confirm date filtering works across all ASIN data

### Phase 5: Production Monitoring
- [ ] **Monitor ongoing sync health**: Track sync success rates after migration
- [ ] **Set up ASIN length monitoring**: Create alerts for any future ASIN length issues
- [ ] **Document sync performance**: Record baseline performance metrics post-migration
- [ ] **Validate data freshness**: Ensure new data continues syncing properly
- [ ] **Monitor dashboard performance**: Check for any performance degradation with increased data

### Phase 6: Documentation & Cleanup
- [ ] **Document migration execution**: Record exact steps taken, timing, and results
- [ ] **Update migration status**: Mark migration as completed in tracking systems
- [ ] **Clean up temporary files**: Remove any backup files or temporary scripts used
- [ ] **Update troubleshooting docs**: Add any new insights to troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] **Create success criteria checklist**: Document what "successful migration" looks like for future reference

### Success Criteria
- All ASIN columns successfully extended to VARCHAR(15) without data loss
- BigQuery sync completes without ASIN length constraint errors
- Dashboard displays all ASINs including 11-character ones
- Sync performance remains stable or improves
- No data integrity issues introduced by migration
- All automated tests pass after migration
