# BigQuery SQP Pipeline Implementation Recap

**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Feature:** BigQuery Data Pipeline for SQP Data Processing  
**Status:** 4/5 Tasks Completed (80% Complete)  

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive BigQuery data pipeline for processing Amazon Search Query Performance (SQP) data. The pipeline handles data extraction, transformation, aggregation, and optimized storage with robust authentication, connection pooling, and comprehensive testing.

## Completed Features

### 1. BigQuery Authentication & Client Setup ✅

- Added query cost estimation using dry-run queries with per-TB pricing
- Created exponential backoff retry logic for transient errors
- Configured environment-specific settings for dev/staging/production
- **Test Coverage:** 31 tests (16 client + 15 connection pool tests) - All passing

### 2. Data Extraction & Query Pipeline ✅
**Status:** Complete  
**Implementation Details:**
- Created SQPQueryBuilder with parameterized queries for flexible data extraction
- Built comprehensive filtering system (date ranges, ASIN lists, keyword matching)
- Implemented incremental extraction with timestamp-based watermarks
- Added streaming data extraction with configurable batch sizes
- Integrated DataValidator for batch validation and quality checks
- Optimized queries with partition pruning and efficient patterns
- **Test Coverage:** 22 test cases covering all extraction scenarios - All passing

### 3. Data Transformation & Aggregation ✅
**Status:** Complete  
**Implementation Details:**
- Built PeriodAggregator supporting weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly aggregations
- Implemented period-over-period calculations (WoW, MoM, QoQ, YoY comparisons)
- Created keyword performance scoring algorithm based on purchase attribution and ROI
- Added market share calculations for competitive analysis
- Computed derived metrics (CTR, CVR, average position, purchase share)
- Integrated data quality monitoring for anomaly detection
- **Test Coverage:** 77 tests (66 transformation + 11 period aggregator) - All passing

### 4. Optimized Table Creation & Management ✅
**Status:** Complete  
**Implementation Details:**
- Created BigQueryTableManager with comprehensive lifecycle functionality
- Designed optimized Supabase schemas with proper indexes and constraints
- Built materialized views for trends, market share, and performance scores
- Implemented table lifecycle management (archiving, expiration, cleanup)
- Added automated maintenance and refresh capabilities
- Created BigQuery to Supabase sync utility for backup/recovery
- Added deduplication logic with unique constraints
- **Test Coverage:** 20 table management tests - All passing

### 5. Pipeline Orchestration & Monitoring ⏳
**Status:** In Progress  
**Remaining Work:**
- Railway cron job configuration for scheduled execution
- Pipeline orchestration logic for step dependencies
- Monitoring dashboard for health tracking
- Alerting system for failures and performance issues
- Pipeline state management for retries and recovery
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing
- End-to-end pipeline tests

## Technical Achievements

### Code Quality & Testing
- **Total Test Coverage:** 150+ comprehensive tests across all components
- **Test Pass Rate:** 100% - All implemented features fully tested
- **Code Structure:** Well-organized TypeScript modules with proper separation of concerns

### Performance & Scalability
- Connection pooling for efficient BigQuery resource utilization
- Streaming data processing to handle large result sets
- Incremental extraction to process only new/updated records
