# Product Mission

## Pitch

SQP Intelligence Platform is an AI-powered analytics platform that helps Amazon sellers and agencies understand their true search performance by revealing the hidden purchase layer of Amazon rankings and providing an AI analyst that can answer complex questions, generate custom reports, and create visualizations on-demand.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Amazon Sellers ($1M-$100M revenue)**: Brands selling directly on Amazon who need to understand their true search performance beyond traditional rank tracking
- **Amazon Agencies**: Service providers managing multiple brand accounts who need scalable insights and reporting
- **E-commerce Managers**: In-house teams responsible for Amazon channel performance and optimization

## The Problem

### Invisible Purchase Layer

Traditional Amazon tools show keyword rankings but not actual purchase behavior. Sellers invest millions in keywords that rank well but generate few purchases. Our research shows 67% of top-ranking keywords drive less than 10% of category purchases.

**Our Solution:** Reveal the complete purchase data layer that Amazon hides, showing exactly which keywords drive real sales.

### Analysis Paralysis

E-commerce teams drown in data but lack insights. Creating a single performance report requires 8+ hours of manual Excel work across multiple data sources. 73% of sellers make keyword decisions based on incomplete data.

**Our Solution:** AI analyst that instantly answers complex questions and generates visual reports in seconds, not hours.

### Reactive Decision Making

Teams discover problems weeks after they occur. By the time ranking drops appear in traditional tools, competitors have already captured market share. Average detection time for performance issues: 3-4 weeks.

**Our Solution:** Predictive intelligence that forecasts issues before they impact sales and suggests proactive optimizations.

## Differentiators

### True Purchase Intelligence

Unlike Helium10 or Jungle Scout that show estimated search volumes, we reveal actual purchase data from Amazon's Search Query Performance reports. This results in 90% more accurate keyword ROI calculations and 3x faster identification of profitable keywords.

### Conversational AI Analytics

Unlike static dashboards in Seller Central or third-party tools, our AI analyst understands context and can answer complex multi-step questions. This results in 85% reduction in analysis time and enables non-technical users to extract advanced insights without SQL knowledge.

### Predictive Optimization Engine

Unlike reactive reporting tools, we use machine learning on historical SQP data to forecast performance changes. This results in 2-week advance warning for ranking drops and 40% improvement in budget allocation efficiency through "what-if" scenario modeling.
