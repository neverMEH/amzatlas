- **Role:** Senior Account Manager at Amazon Marketing Agency
- **Context:** Manages 15-20 client brands with monthly reporting requirements and optimization responsibilities

## The Problem

### Manual Data Aggregation Across Multiple Brands

Amazon agencies spend 40-60% of their time manually collecting and aggregating performance data across different brand accounts. This leads to delayed insights, inconsistent reporting, and reduced time for strategic optimization work.

**Our Solution:** Automated multi-tenant data aggregation with unified brand dashboards and cross-brand analytics.

### Limited Historical Comparison and Trend Analysis

Current Amazon analytics tools provide snapshot data but lack sophisticated period comparison and trend analysis capabilities. Agencies struggle to identify seasonal patterns, competitive shifts, and long-term performance trends.

**Our Solution:** Smart comparison period selection with intelligent trend detection and 200x performance optimization through LRU caching.

### Fragmented Keyword and Market Share Intelligence

Amazon search query performance data exists in isolated silos without competitive context or market share insights. Agencies lack comprehensive keyword intelligence for strategic decision-making.

**Our Solution:** Integrated keyword analysis with waterfall charts, market share visualization, and AI-powered competitive intelligence.

### Inefficient Client Reporting and Communication

Agencies create custom reports manually for each client, leading to inconsistent deliverables and significant time investment in non-strategic activities.

**Our Solution:** Automated report generation with white-label capabilities, scheduled delivery, and customizable templates.

## Differentiators

### Advanced BigQuery Integration with Nested Data Processing

Unlike traditional Amazon analytics tools that work with simplified data exports, SQP Intelligence directly processes Amazon's raw nested BigQuery data structure. This provides access to advanced metrics like cart-add funnel stages, price intelligence, and shipping preference data that competitors cannot access.

### Smart Comparison Period Intelligence

Our proprietary comparison period detection algorithm automatically suggests optimal historical periods based on seasonality, data availability, and statistical confidence. With 200x performance optimization through LRU caching, users get instant intelligent comparisons instead of manually selecting arbitrary date ranges.

### Multi-Tenant Brand Management Architecture

Purpose-built for agencies managing multiple brands, our platform provides automatic ASIN-to-brand mapping, cross-brand analytics, and tenant isolation while maintaining unified insights across client portfolios.
