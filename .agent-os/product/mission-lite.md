# Product Mission (Lite)

SQP Intelligence is a multi-tenant Amazon agency SaaS platform that helps Amazon agencies manage multiple brands efficiently by providing AI-powered search query performance analytics and automated brand intelligence.

SQP Intelligence serves Amazon marketing agencies and multi-brand sellers who need consolidated analytics across client portfolios. Unlike traditional Amazon tools that work with simplified exports, SQP Intelligence processes raw BigQuery data directly, providing advanced metrics like cart-add funnels and price intelligence while delivering 200x faster comparisons through intelligent period detection and LRU caching optimization.
